# iOS 13 Stopwatch App

This is a very simple and very clean stopwatch app that I wrote in Swift as one of my first iOS projects. The idea of the app is simple, and it is based around the NSTimer interface provided by Apple. 

The interface consists of three buttons: Start, Stop and Restart. Whenever the timer is running, the start button will be disabled. Whenever the timer is paused, the pause button disabled, and the start button enabled.
As per today I have no plans of releasing this app on the AppStore as it is just a side project for me to enjoy and practice Swift with.

## What I'm working on
Currently in the works is:
* A cleaner UI
* Haptic feedback using the Taptic Engine indicating evert passed minute
* Ability to run in the background and send notification when a certain ammount of time has passed,  
like " 20 minutes passed "

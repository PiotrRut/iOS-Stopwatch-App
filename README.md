# iOS Stopwatch App

This is a very simple and  clean stopwatch app that I wrote in Swift as one of my first iOS projects. The idea of the app is simple, and it is based around the NSTimer interface provided by Apple. It is compatible with all iPhone models running iOS 11 or newer.

The interface consists of three buttons: Start, Stop and Restart. Whenever the timer is running, the start button will be disabled. Whenever the timer is paused, the pause button becomes disabled, and the start button enabled. Each button has enabled haptic feedback using the Taptic Engine.

As per today I have no plans of releasing this app on the AppStore as it is just a side project for me to enjoy and practice Swift.

In no particular order:

- [x] Haptic feedback using the Taptic Engine indicating every passed minute (requires iPhone 7 or newer)
